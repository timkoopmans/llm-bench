Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/assign_elements_to_groups_with_constraints/

QUESTION:
You are given an integer array groups, where groups[i] represents the size of the i^th group. You are also given an integer array elements.
Your task is to assign one element to each group based on the following rules:

An element at index j can be assigned to a group i if groups[i] is divisible by elements[j].
If there are multiple elements that can be assigned, assign the element with the smallest index j.
If no element satisfies the condition for a group, assign -1 to that group.

Return an integer array assigned, where assigned[i] is the index of the element chosen for group i, or -1 if no suitable element exists.
Note: An element may be assigned to more than one group.
 
Example 1:

Input: groups = [8,4,3,2,4], elements = [4,2]
Output: [0,0,-1,1,0]
Explanation:

elements[0] = 4 is assigned to groups 0, 1, and 4.
elements[1] = 2 is assigned to group 3.
Group 2 cannot be assigned any element.


Example 2:

Input: groups = [2,3,5,7], elements = [5,3,3]
Output: [-1,1,0,-1]
Explanation:

elements[1] = 3 is assigned to group 1.
elements[0] = 5 is assigned to group 2.
Groups 0 and 3 cannot be assigned any element.


Example 3:

Input: groups = [10,21,30,41], elements = [2,1]
Output: [0,1,0,1]
Explanation:
elements[0] = 2 is assigned to the groups with even values, and elements[1] = 1 is assigned to the groups with odd values.

 
Constraints:

1 <= groups.length <= 10^5
1 <= elements.length <= 10^5
1 <= groups[i] <= 10^5
1 <= elements[i] <= 10^5

NOTE FOR THE MODEL:
Implement class `Solution` with method `assignElements` exactly matching
the signature in the starter code below. Do NOT include any tests,
doctests, or `if __name__` block. Your code will be concatenated
above the spec which runs your Solution against canonical tests.

STARTER CODE:
class Solution:
    def assignElements(self, groups: List[int], elements: List[int]) -> List[int]:
