"""LiveCodeBench 3794 — find-the-minimum-amount-of-time-to-brew-potions (leetcode, 2025-03-22, medium)

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find_the_minimum_amount_of_time_to_brew_potions/

QUESTION:
You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.
In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the i^th wizard on the j^th potion is time_ij = skill[i] * mana[j].
Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. ​
Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.
 
Example 1:

Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
Output: 110
Explanation:



Potion Number
Start time
Wizard 0 done by
Wizard 1 done by
Wizard 2 done by
Wizard 3 done by


0
0
5
30
40
60


1
52
53
58
60
64


2
54
58
78
86
102


3
86
88
98
102
110



As an example for why wizard 0 cannot start working on the 1^st potion before time t = 52, consider the case where the wizards started preparing the 1^st potion at time t = 50. At time t = 58, wizard 2 is done with the 1^st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on the 0^th potion till time t = 60.

Example 2:

Input: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]
Output: 5
Explanation:

Preparation of the 0^th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by time t = 3.
Preparation of the 1^st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by time t = 4.
Preparation of the 2^nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed by time t = 5.


Example 3:

Input: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]
Output: 21

 
Constraints:

n == skill.length
m == mana.length
1 <= n, m <= 5000
1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000

NOTE FOR THE MODEL:
Implement class `Solution` with method `minTime` exactly matching
the signature in the starter code below. Do NOT include any tests,
doctests, or `if __name__` block. Your code will be concatenated
above the spec which runs your Solution against canonical tests.

STARTER CODE:
class Solution:
    def minTime(self, skill: List[int], mana: List[int]) -> int:
